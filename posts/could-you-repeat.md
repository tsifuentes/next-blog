# Could you repeat please?

There are many ways you can ask for somebody to repeat something you could not get it or you could not pay attention.

Let's take a look at these ones:

> <b>"Came again?"</b><br> It's something like you could not understand clearly and please repeat it in a polite way.<br>

> <b>"Apologies, I couldn't follow you"</b> <br>You are not understanding and need a better explanation (implicit).<br>

> <b>"I'm not sure if I get it, you meant..."</b> <br> If you feel confident, you can try to explain what you did undertstand and asking a correction implicitly
