# How to begin?

The idea is collecting resources, ideas, advices from Native and Experts in the language. I have found and practiced the following path:

## Beginner
- Main topic: Vocabulary
It is a important and really key stuff to learn many words as we can, not only for repeating but get their meanings. Use your books, apps, webs, youtube videos, and repeat all of them and understand them clearly. I recomend at least five (5) words a day. Build your own dictionary with your own words!

## Intermediate
- Main topic: Grammar
Put in context the words you have learnt (learned for USA, CAN) previously.

## Advance
- Main topic: Read & Write

## Native
- Main topic: Fluid conversation
